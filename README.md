# HomeVibe System

## Problem Statement

1. The real estate industry largely depends on imagination and speculation, both by the user and customer. The builder and architects design the house according to their imaginations and designs which may or may not be liked by the user, however the user never got a chance to look at the design in the first place.

2. The modeling and designing in the real estate industry is generally done in a 2-D format, in a sheet of A-4 paper or brochures. The customer might not be able to visualize the exact dimensions of the house since it is impossible to be done in a 2-D Environment. 

3. A user/customer buying the house cannot change the design and colors of the house after it is built. All he can do is regret not to have changed earlier.




## Steps Involved in the project:

1. Preaparing a model of the House

## Features 

1. Helps designers to eliminate any scope of calculation error from creeping in.Designers can let us walk through designs and interact in endless possible ways

2. Modify or hide walls, doors, furniture, change color of wall paint, add or remove layers

3. Infinite customization

4. VR enabled illustrations are the exact replica of the design to the exact 1:1 scale.

5. With the assistance of virtual reality software; projects, designs and concepts can be â€¨brought to life prior to execution, so no need to start breaking ground or buying materials.

6. Giving designers the ability to finalize details through effective planning and visual conceptualizations means that project viability can be determined much earlier in the process

7. These detailed and explicit plans can then be accurately communicated to contractors and construction teams.
